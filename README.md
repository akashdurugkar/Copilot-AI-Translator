## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered translations)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ## Copilot Localization Translator

   Modern Tkinter desktop utility to load, explore, translate, and export Microsoft Copilot Studio localization JSON while preserving key order and boosting productivity.

   ### ‚ú® Features
   * Order‚Äëstable JSON parse & export
   * Topic + component heuristic extraction
   * Skips global/system variables
   * Parallel AI translation with live progress
   * Cancel/Stop mid‚Äëbatch (cooperative)
   * Multiple translation style modes
   * Rich filtering: text / topic / component / status
   * Bulk + smart selection helpers (all, visible, invert, clear)
   * Details panel for large text editing
   * Status badges (Pending / Translated) + selection count
   * Light / Dark / System themes (token driven)
   * Rounded accessible button components
   * Zebra striping & centered columns
   * Topic value sanitization (fixes stray trailing ) )

   ### üñ• Layout Overview
   Top bar: file actions, translation controls, theme toggle.
   Filter bar: search + dropdown filters + clear.
   Translation table: key rows (Original / Translation / Topic / Component / Status).
   Details panel: expanded view for editing long strings.
   Status bar: progress, cancel control, selection metadata.

   ### üèó Key Modules
   | File | Purpose |
   |------|---------|
   | `main.py` | UI composition, theming, threading, filtering, table mgmt |
   | `localization_parser.py` | JSON ingest, topic/component heuristics, filtering globals |
   | `translation_service.py` | Translation abstraction (swap provider here) |
   | `config_manager.py` | (Legacy) configuration utilities (future refactor) |
   | `Sample.json` | Example input data (demo + legacy test scaffolding removed) |

   ### ‚öô Concurrency
   Bounded worker pool + shared cancellation flag; workers enqueue progress events consumed on the Tk main loop for safe UI updates.

   ### üé® Theming
   `DESIGN_TOKENS` drives semantic colors and spacing. Theme switch recalculates palette and Treeview header styling for contrast.

   ### üöÄ Quick Start
   1. `python main.py`
   2. File ‚Üí Open Localization File‚Ä¶
   3. Choose target language / style
   4. (Optional) refine via filters
   5. Translate (All or Selected)
   6. Review & edit
   7. Export translated file

   ### üß™ Validation
   Ensures non‚Äëempty translation values; planned: placeholder preservation, glossary enforcement.

   ### üõ£ Roadmap (Planned)
   * Persist theme & window geometry
   * Collapsible filter bar
   * Inline row quick actions
   * Provider strategy + caching
   * Diff & change highlighting
   * Glossary / terminology module
   * Quality scoring heuristics
   * Delta export mode
   * Keyboard shortcut palette
   * Binary packaging (PyInstaller)

   ### üîß Extending
   * Add styles: extend mapping in `translation_service.py`.
   * Extra filters: add column + logic in `SimpleTranslationTable.apply_filters`.
   * New backend: implement same interface as `TranslationService` and swap construction.

   ### üìÇ Input Format
   Flat or nested JSON of localization keys to strings. Parser derives topic/component segments from structured key paths. Non-user-facing keys excluded where identifiable.

   ### üßµ Thread Safety
   Only main thread touches widgets. Workers push events through a queue; UI loop drains and applies.

   ### üõ° Errors
   Individual translation failures are isolated; batch continues and UI status updates accordingly.

   ### üåó Theme Snapshot
   Light: layered neutrals w/ indigo accents
   Dark: charcoal surfaces w/ indigo + cyan
   Shared scale: radii 6/10/18, spacing 4/8/12/20

## API Costs

Translation costs depend on the OpenAI model used:

- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.06 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.001 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.002 per 1K output tokens

The application includes a cost estimation feature to help you budget translation projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No OpenAI client" error**:
   - Ensure your API key is set in the `.env` file
   - Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

2. **Translation fails**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify API key permissions
   - Try reducing batch size in settings

3. **File parsing errors**:
   - Ensure the file is a valid Copilot Studio localization JSON
   - Check file encoding (should be UTF-8)

4. **UI responsiveness issues**:
   - Large files may take time to load
   - Use search/filter to work with subsets of data

### Development Mode

To run without an OpenAI API key (uses mock translations):
```bash
python main.py
```

Mock translations will be marked with style prefixes like `[FORMAL]`, `[CONV]`, or `[BOT]`.
